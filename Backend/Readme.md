why we need both ( redux Thunk ) + (interceptor) to handle 401

🔍 What Happens When the User Opens the App?
useEffect(() => {
dispatch(fetchCurrentUser()); // Runs on app startup
}, [dispatch]);

1️⃣ fetchCurrentUser() runs on app load.
2️⃣ fetchCurrentUser() calls getCurrentUser().
3️⃣ getCurrentUser() makes a request:
const response = await api.get(`/current-user`);
4️⃣ The API responds with 401 Unauthorized if the token is expired.

❌ Why Doesn't the Interceptor Catch It?
Even though the request uses the api instance, the issue is how the failure is handled in fetchCurrentUser():
 //we Manually refreshing token in catch() part



🔍 So whats the point of keeping both interceptorr and redux thunk to handle 401 ??? why it is good practice -
It might seem like duplicate logic, but keeping both is actually a best practice in a production-ready app. Here's why:

1️⃣ Interceptor Handles API Requests After Login
✅ The Axios interceptor automatically refreshes the token for all API requests except the first one (fetchCurrentUser).
✅ This prevents every API call from manually checking for 401.
✅ Keeps the code clean and centralized—no need to repeat token refresh logic in every API call.
🚀 Example:
User browses products (GET /products)
Request fails with 401 → Interceptor refreshes token automatically
Request retries with the new token ✅

2️⃣ Redux Thunk Handles the First API Call (fetchCurrentUser)
✅ When the app opens, the first request is fetchCurrentUser().
✅ If the token is expired, the interceptor hasn’t triggered yet.
✅ So, fetchCurrentUser() manually handles 401 → refresh → retry.
🚀 Example:
User opens the app
fetchCurrentUser() runs → GET /current-user fails with 401
fetchCurrentUser() refreshes the token manually
User stays logged in ✅



🔍can interceptor catch FIRST 401 error ? if yes then whats the probelm if interceptor handdle the first 401 error? :
Yes, the interceptor can catch the first 401 error, but here's the problem:
🔴 Problem: Interceptor Doesn't Run Until an API Request Fails
When the user opens the app, fetchCurrentUser() runs immediately.
If the token is expired, the request fails with 401.
The interceptor can only trigger if Axios makes the request first.
But at this point, the app already thinks the user is logged out before the interceptor refreshes the token.
